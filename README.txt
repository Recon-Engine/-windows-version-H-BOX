### NOTE : Your Windows Anti Virus will delete many of the tools in the software folder ---

#1 In order to run the tool properly you must install python3.9
I also suggest installing python3.8 to avoid complications

#2 - copy the folder directory to the HACKERS BOX's main folder and access it through [ COMMAND PROMT]cmd<
         [ EXAMPLE COMMAND : cd "user/Desktop/WINDOWS VERSION/HACKERS BOX v?.?" ]

#3 - Run the following command to install the modules
         [ COMMAND : pip3 install requirements.txt ]

#4 - Then run the following command to launch the tool manager
         [ COMMAND  : python3 Hackers-BOX.py ]

#5 - Open the tools menu and choose any of the tools and one of them will ask you to install [ .NET]
so install .NET and your all set with the tool 
                                                       :) ENJOY
